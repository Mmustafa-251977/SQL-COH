## 🧠 Introduction to Databases and SQL

### 📊 What is a Database?

A **database** is an organized collection of structured data stored and accessed electronically.
Databases are used to **store, manage, and retrieve** data efficiently in various applications — such as websites, mobile apps, and enterprise systems.

### 💻 What is SQL?

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating **relational databases**.
It is used to **create**, **modify**, and **query** databases and is supported by most **RDBMS** platforms like:

### ❓ What is a Query?

A **query** is a request for specific data or information from a database.
SQL queries use defined syntax and commands to retrieve the desired data based on conditions.

**In simple terms:**

> A query is a *question you ask a database* to get specific information.
